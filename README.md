Yeah, I know that your github is supposed to act like your resume and stuff, but honestly, I have no experience or whatever, so thinking about this stuff makes me sad.

<sub><sup><sub><sup>TBH I drown out the endless loneliness by making stupid shit, which gives me a small, fleeting sensation of validation when the stupid thing actually works, but most of the time, i'm too unmotivated to finish what i started, resulting in lots of failed/unfinished projects all around my room, which gives me more feelings of hopelessness. I just want to be loved.</sup></sub></sup></sub>

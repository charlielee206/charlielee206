## what do i write here idk OwO
I make useless stuff.<br>
I can do a little bit of C++. Also a wee bit of Arduino Stuff.<br>
I can also do a teeny bit of 3D modeling and printing.<br>

I will probably upload 3D models to my [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/charlie_lee_rhee/designs), and upload the rest here. I probably should upload more hardware stuff here, but I'm too lazy to export cloud based stuff or to manage and organize files. So unless it's a big-ish project, I'll probably drag-drop my working vscode workspace folder and call it a day. Nobody's going to look through it anyways. 


### Tools and stuff I use:
<details>
 <summary><b>Software</b></summary>

**Programming/Editors**<br>

- VSCode
> Most of the work is done here. I use PlatformIO to do the microcontroller stuff.<be>
- Arduino IDE<br>
> Use to quickly check stuff without creating a whole new project in PlatformIO.<br>
> Simple. Elegant. It just works.<br>
- Notepad
> Used to check different files in a pinch.<br>
 
#### 3D modeling & Printing
- Fusion 360
> Most of the heavy lifting is done here. Say whatever you want about their business model, but you have to admit that autodesk makes some good software.
- FreeCAD
> Plan B. I'm still teaching myself FreeCAD, but it's hard.
- Meshmixer
> Used to edit STL files.
- Microsoft 3D Builder
> One of the most underrated 3D mesh programs in existance. The auto-fix tool is one of the fastest and easiest way to fix non-manifold models. Yes, it's worse than going into blender/meshmixer and manually editing each and every polygon, but honestly, the output is usually very nice, and almost always useable. 
- Blender
> Used to fix non-manifold models, and prepare them for printing.
- Cura
> My go-to slicer.

 <summary><b>Hardware</b></summary> 
 
- Peanut MK.I
> LITERALLY a piece of junk. The design is from 2013 ffs. And it's not even a proper peanut. Built from broken, bottom-of-the-barrel parts and broken acryllic pieces. <br>
> But it still chugs on, and I think that's nice. Has Horrible z-artifacts, but is still useable after all these years. After all it's been through, it's basically a war veteran at this point.<br>
> Mods: 2020 extrusion frame, heated bed, Octoprint and firmware upgrade. Also, general parts swap and maintenance.  
- VORON V0
> The print quality is just. *kisses air* Mwah! Mmmh! Yeah,Boi It's the good stuff. but hoLY FUCK ITS SO LOUD WHAT THE FUCK WHY THE FUCK WHAT WHY HOW If I print over 40mm/s (Which I admit, is sorta slightly speedy for a stock v6 hotend) the thing starts bweeping like a geriatric fax machine from the 80's like WOW <br>
> Also, the 30mm fan is SO LOUD WHAT IS THIS A JET ENGINE? It goes SHWWWEEEWWWWWWRRRRWWWWWEEESSSSHHHHHH AND I CANT HEAR MY SELF THINK ITS AS IF IM IN A JET ENGINE WIND TUNNEL<br>
> But yeah, amazing print quality, 10/10 would build again.
- Hypercube Evolution
> WIP.<br>

Yeah, I know that your github is supposed to act like your resume and stuff, but honestly, I have no experience or whatever, so thinking about this stuff makes me sad.
Im just a stupid idiot someone please adopt me

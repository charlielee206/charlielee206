## 아직까지는 살아있는 인간 유체입니다.
이것저것 쓸때없는거 만드는거 좋아합니다.<br>
C++ 조금 할 수 있습니다. 아두이노도 조금 할 수 있고요.<br>
3D 프린터 잘 다룹니다. Fusion 360 으로 모델링 할 수 있습니다만은 자신은 없습니다.<br>



### Tools and stuff I use:
<details>
 <summary><b>Software</b></summary>

**Programming/Editors**<br>

- VSCode
> Most of the work is done here. I use PlatformIO to do the microcontroller stuff.<be>
- Arduino IDE<br>
> Use to quickly check stuff without creating a whole new project in PlatformIO.<br>
> Simple. Elegant. It just works.<br>
- Notepad
> Used to check different files in a pinch.<br><br>
 
#### 3D modeling & Printing
- Fusion 360
> Most of the heavy lifting is done here. Say whatever you want about their business model, but you have to admit that autodesk makes some good software.
- FreeCAD
> Plan B. I'm still teaching myself FreeCAD, but it's hard.
- Meshmixer
> Used to edit STL files.
- Blender
> Used to fix non-manifold models, and prepare them for printing.
- Cura
> My go-to slicer.

 <summary><b>Hardware</b></summary> 
 
- Peanut MK.I
> LITERALLY a piece of junk. The design is from 2013 ffs. And it's not even a proper peanut. Built from broken, bottom-of-the-barrel parts and broken acryllic pieces. <br>
> But it still chugs on, and I think that's nice. Has Horrible z-artifacts, but is still useable after all these years. After all it's been through, it's basically a war veteran at this point.<br>
> Mods: 2020 extrusion frame, heated bed, Octoprint and firmware upgrade. Also, general parts swap and maintenance.  
- VORON V0
> Still needs tuning.
- Hypercube Evolution
> WIP.<br>

Yeah, I know that your github is supposed to act like your resume and stuff, but honestly, I have no experience or whatever, so thinking about this stuff makes me sad.

<sub><sup><sub><sup>TBH I drown out the endless loneliness by making stupid shit, which gives me a small, fleeting sensation of validation when the stupid thing actually works, but most of the time, i'm too unmotivated to finish what i started, resulting in lots of failed/unfinished projects all around my room, which gives me more feelings of hopelessness. I just want to be loved.</sup></sub></sup></sub>
